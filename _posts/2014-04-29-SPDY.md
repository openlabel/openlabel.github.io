## SPDY (SPeeDY protocol)

This week we rolled out the most recent version of SPDY, 3.1. SPDY/3.1 is supported by Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.

SDPY is a next generation protocol that aims to speed up the loading of web pages. For technical details, check out the <a href="http://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper">SPDY Whitepaper</a> by the Chromium team.

To discover the exact version used you can dive into Chrome's <a href="chrome://net-internals">chrome://net-internals</a> where the version is shown for each connection. In addition, you can use the handly <a href="http://spdycheck.org/#theopenlabel.com">SPDYCheck</a> tool to verify SDPY support.
