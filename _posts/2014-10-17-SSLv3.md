## Disabling support for SLv3 

As of today we have switched off SSLv3 support on Openlabel's servers due to the POODLE vulnerability.

It is recommened you upgrade your browser and ensure it is secure against this type of attack. You can check if your browser is vulnerable using the <a href="https://www.poodletest.com/">POODLE Test</a> site.
